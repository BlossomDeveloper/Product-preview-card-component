## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I enjoyed this component and was much more easier for me to actually use media queries for mobile/desktop approaches.

Was also the first time I used 2 different images for different screen sizes, after some search I was able to do it with no issue!

### Continued development

I will keep doing components as I think this gives me more room to try new things and improve my developer skills.

### Useful resources

- W3 Schools(https://www.w3schools.com) - Helped me with media queries and 2 images for different sizes.
